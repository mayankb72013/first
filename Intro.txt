First we used a command --  git init 
this has initialized the folder with git and now the version control system is enabled

All the configurations are stored in the .git/ folder which is a hidden folder and can be seen if we type 'ls -la' in the bash terminal.

To enable the tracking for a file 'git add <filepath>'

To enable tracking for an entire folder 'git add .'

after making the changes if we type 'git diff' we get to see the changes made in the file with respect to the original file.
