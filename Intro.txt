First we used a command --  git init 
this has initialized the folder with git and now the version control system is enabled

All the configurations are stored in the .git/ folder which is a hidden folder and can be seen if we type 'ls -la' in the bash terminal.

To enable the tracking for a file 'git add <filepath>'

To enable tracking for an entire folder 'git add .'

after making the changes if we type 'git diff' we get to see the changes made in the file with respect to the original file.

'git log' allows us to know all the changes we have made in the codebase.

'git log --oneline' shortens the commit id and the entire response of the 'git log'

'git show <commitId>' will give all the changes that have taken place in this commit.

'git blame <filename>' will give you line by line info of who changed what 

'git reset --hard <SHA>' will move the head to the other commit

'git revert <SHA>' will create a new commit reversing the actions of the commit that you have done in the past

STAGING AREA:
=> whenever we make a change in the original document we can see that in the changes 'git status' - modified 
=> if we want to commit our changes we need to move the above file from the changing area ---> staging area.
=> we move files from the changing area --> staging area by 'git add .' or 'git add <filepath>/<filename>' 
=> now we do 'git commit -m "MESSAGE"'
=> To unstage use use 'git restore --stages <file>'
